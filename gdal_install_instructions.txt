sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove 
sudo apt-get install -y cdo nco gdal-bin libgdal-dev

conda install -c conda-forge libgdal
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
conda install tiledb=2.2
conda install poppler
 -> installs osgeo, gdal, poppler, tiledb, etc.
 -> must use "base" environment? don't know how to link to other conda environments.
 -> works in base conda environment.

conda install -c conda-forge libgdal
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
conda install tiledb=2.2
conda install poppler
--> then did conda install all above in new conda environment, and it worked.
